After optimizer conformance and the mature boundary-property and analytical-cost
authorities, implement reviewed opaque physical-call registration and
verification. Cover typed ABI, effects, aliasing, placement, numerical
guarantees, target/applicability requirements, failure stages, provider
provenance, additive coexistence with scheduled kernels, and deterministic
rejection/explain behavior. Keep three typed evidence classes separate:

- exact or proven-upper-bound `ResourceRequirements` used for hard feasibility;
- uncertain `ResourceEstimate`-class pressure estimates with provenance and an
  explicit `Unknown` state, including registers, occupancy, and source size;
- an analytical cost estimate with exact model provenance and an explicit
  unavailable/`Unknown` state.

Unknown resource estimates cannot establish hard feasibility. Unknown cost
cannot silently become zero, infinity, or an arbitrary winner. Calibration
remains deferred to the separate measurement/activation ticket. Opaque calls
remain explicit physical boundaries and may not smuggle unknown semantics or
effects into logical IR.

Any consequential public or cross-crate crate, module, trait, type, or call-site
boundary remains a draft until Tom reviews and accepts the exact implementation
commit. This ticket does not preselect that interface.
