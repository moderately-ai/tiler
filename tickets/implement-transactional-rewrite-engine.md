Implement the bounded external rule-provider and transactional alternative
engine after the ordinary optimizer path is proven. Preserve exact rule and
provider identity, termination/budget contracts, semantic revalidation,
rollback, deterministic traversal, and typed explain. Unknown provider behavior
is never optimizable merely because it is registered.

Any consequential public or cross-crate crate, module, trait, type, or call-site boundary remains a draft until Tom reviews and accepts the exact implementation commit. This ticket does not preselect that interface.
